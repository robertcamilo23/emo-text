# Welcome to the Emo-Text Developer Community #

Thank you for considering helping us in further development of the Application. With your contributions we can make Emo-Text a unique and rich application for everyone who wishes to use it!

# How can I help? #

There are many things that individuals could use to help us make this project a cool and interactive Application. Some of these jobs include:

  * Application Development (Coding)
  * Documentation (Technical + Civilian)
  * Content Providers (Sound, Videos, Clips, Demos, etc.)
  * Design and UI (Look and feel of Emo-Text)
  * Bug Catchers (Looking for errors)
  * Performance Developers (Faster + flawless processing)
  * Multiple Platform Adapters (iOS, Windows Phone, OSX / PC Adaptions)

# Developers Incentive #

If would like to become a member of our developing team simply send us an email specifying all the roles in which you would like to contribute. Upon receipt and occupancy, we will gladly include you to one or multiple of the developers section for access to all of the source code.

Will the developers be paid?
Yes, a tenth-fold in karma and kindness, but _not in any currency that you could ever materialize or be traded for any goods_. This is an open source project that stays true to being open source and _expects no source of revenue by either selling ad space or publishing ads within the application._

How can I obtain commit privileges?
We regard commit privileges as the highest reward that we can offer our developers. Therefore, in order to gain our trust you will have to earn it. When you have managed to suggest at least five events of either bug fixes and or positive and constructive code, you will be considered for commit privileges and you will be able to update the source code at any point by simply committing and pushing your changes to Google Code.
