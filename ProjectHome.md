### Messaging with Emotions! ###

Emo-Text is a messaging application for Android that will enable users to communicate their instant emotions and reactions to messages being received. In traditional messaging applications context can be lost due to the misinterpretation of text, however, Emo-Text will interpret your reaction based on textual recognition. Emo-Text reads your incoming messages and interprets and expresses the sentiment of emotion with colors and emoticons.

## Features include: ##
  * A fully functioning instant messenger application
  * Psycho-linguistic index recognition
  * Facebook Log-in Integration

## Possible future features to include: ##
  * Facial Recognition for Interpretation of Emotions
    * Part of the code can be restricted from distribution due to other licensing agreements
  * Multiple language support
  * Cross platform availability (iOS, Windows, PC...)
  * Any suggestions will be considered.
