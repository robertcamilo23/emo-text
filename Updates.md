# Project Updates #

  * 3.02.2014 - Server up and running for test, preliminary test do not show positive results. Emo-Text native stage, coming together as a basic messenger application on a localhost 'the development lab'.

  * 3.16.2014 - Emo-Text runs with errors, not ready for production server connection. Production server's firewall causing MySQL ports to be blocked working to get things up and running soon.

  * 3.26.2014 - Emo-Text is running in the development lab. It is able to read the messages and interpret some emotions based on the content of the messages. Our goal is to ultimately have it recognize human expression but it does not include such functionality as it stands.

  * 3.28.2014 - First tests for Facebook Login Integration scheduled.

  * 3.30.2014 - Had a long day of debugging due to trouble brought on to including the Facebook SDK, tired but will hopefully get the Facebook integration and session covered tomorrow morning / tonight.

  * 4.09.2014 - Robert greatly improved the native UI on the messaging window by adding text bubbles for the corresponding user. Some minor improvements on the algorithm for text recognition.

  * 4.14.2014 - Improved UI (new icons and layouts)and bug fixes. Application is ready to be published as an Alpha Version on Google Play.

  * 4.21.2014 - Robert modified the Algorithm to work with the Alchemy API as well as a great improvement on color bubbles according to the color integration.

  * 4.26.2014 - Problems with Alchemy have led us to develop or own Algorithm and train the model in both scoring and emotion evaluation.

  * 4.27.2014 - Facebook test successful, need to do further development for creation a session with the data abstracted from the profiles of users, essentially matching the information log-in or open a new account information.

  * 4.29.2014 - More training and testing, further modifications and bug fixes.

  * 4.30.2014 - Final adjustments and testing for presentation, APK ready for Beta release on Google Play, more data updates to better train the algorithm.

# Road-Map #

Over the course of the next two to three weeks, we will be giving Emo-Text a completely new face and interphase to make it more intuitive for all users. We have begun our integration with facial recognition but there is still a lot of work to be done in the coming weeks / months.

In addition, we hope to have a production server up and running to publish the application by the end of April 2014 on Google Play.
